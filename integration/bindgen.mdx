Declaring the interface for blockchain protocol is not very useful unless we have a way to interact programmatically with it.

**Bindgen** is the process of generating the bindings of your Tx3 protocol in a particular general-purpose language.

Bindings are just glue code that allows you to execute the transaction building logic by calling language-specific functions that represent the templates in your protocol.

## Supported Languages

Tx3 bindgen feature can currently generate code in the following target languages:

- Typescript
- Rust
- Go
- Python

We plan on adding more languages as we move forward.

<Aside type="tip">
If you're brave enough, you can peek into the different SDK repos that available in our [Github org](https://github.com/tx3-lang), reverse engineer how they work and build your own. Please share back if you do!

## Configuration

The bindgen configuration lives inside the `trix.toml` file. You need to provide an entry for each language target. Here's an example of the config that targets both Typescript and Rust:

```toml
[[bindings]]
plugin = "typescript"
output_dir = "./gen/typescript"
options = { standalone = true }

[[bindings]]
plugin = "rust"
output_dir = "./gen/rust"
```

Each `bindings` entry has the following schema:

- `plugin`: keyword indicating the target language. Valid values are `typescript`, `rust`, `go` & `python`.
- `output_dir`: root location where the generated code artifacts will be output to.
- `options`: target-specific options that allows you to customize the output.

<Aside type="caution">
Generated code is **not** meant to be manually modified. Any manual changes will be overridden when the bindgen process is executed again.
</Aside>


## Code generation procedure

To run the code generation process, execute the following `trix` command from your CLI:

```
trix bindgen
```

If things went well, you should have new code artifacts in the corresponding output locations as defined in your `trix.toml` file.

The output of the previous configuration example would yield the following new files:

    <TabItem label="Typescript">
    ```
    gen/
    └── typescript/
        ├── my-protocol.ts
        ├── test.ts
        ├── package.json
        └── tsconfig.json
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Rust">
    ```
    gen/
    └── rust/
        ├── my-protocol.rs
        └── Cargo.toml
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We won't get into details of how to use the _ts_ code, you can read more about it on the [NodeJS](./bindings/nodejs) bindings reference.
