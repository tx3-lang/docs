title: Go

To integrate with Go you need to make sure that your _trix_ project has the `go` bindings generation enabled in the config:

```toml
[[bindings]]
plugin = "go"
output_dir = "./gen/go"
```

With the binding generation enabled, run the following command from your CLI to trigger the code generator:

```
trix bindgen
```

If things went well, you should see the following new files:

```
my-protocol/
└── gen/
    └── go/
        ├── protocol.go
        └── go.mod
```

That new `protocol.go` file has the required types and functions to call your protocol from a Go code.

The `go.mod` file is a standard file for Go projects.

Now, we can use the generated bindings to build a transaction using our protocol.

First access to the `gen/go` folder and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd gen/go && go mod tidy 
```

We need to open `protocol.go` and update the TRP endpoint to point to the correct URL (unless you have it configured on trix.toml). The default value is `http://localhost:3000/trp`, but if you're using different port or endpoint, make sure to update it.

For the following example, we will use the main.tx3 file generated by trix.

Now, we can create a new file called `test.go` with the following code on the same folder as `main.tx3`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"protocol"
)

func main() {
	// Create parameters for the transfer
	params := protocol.TransferParams{
		Sender:   "addr_test1vpgcjapuwl7gfnzhzg6svtj0ph3gxu8kyuadudmf0kzsksqrfugfc",
		Receiver: "addr_test1vpry6n9s987fpnmjqcqt9un35t2rx5t66v4x06k9awdm5hqpma4pp",
		Quantity: 100000000,
	}

	// Execute the transfer transaction
	cbor, err := protocol.DefaultClient.TransferTx(params)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error: %v", err)
	}

	// Print the result
	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", cbor)
}
```

For this, add the protocol as a dependency in your `go.mod` file:

```go
require protocol v0.0.0

replace protocol => ./gen/go
```

Finally, we can run the test file to build a transaction using our protocol:
```bash
go run test.go
```
If everything went well, you should see a message like this:

```bash
