This guide explains how to run the Devnet network for testing purposes.

## Overview

Devnet is a custom Cardano test network powered by [Dolos](https://docs.txpipe.io/dolos). It allows you to define initial wallet funds, execute transactions, etc. To set up the environment, you must run [tx3up](./tx3up). It launches Dolos using custom genesis files for the Devnet network.

## Usage

Before running Devnet, use [trix init](./trix#trix-init) to initialize a tx3 project. This will generate a default Devnet configuration in the `trix.toml` file, including default wallets.  
After initializing the project, run [trix devnet](./trix#trix-devnet) to start the Devnet.

```sh
trix devnet
```

> **Note:** The password for each Devnet wallet is the same as the wallet name defined in `trix.toml` (e.g., if the name is `bob`, the password is `bob`).

## Common Workflows

Here are some common workflows you might follow when you are running devnet:

<Steps>

1. Initialize a New Project:

   ```sh
   trix init
   ```

   This will create a `trix.toml` file with a default Devnet configuration and wallets.

2. Start the Devnet:
   ```sh
   trix devnet
   ```

   This launches a local Cardano test network powered by Dolos.

3. (Optional) Run Devnet in the Background:
   ```sh
   trix devnet -b
   ```

   Use this if you want Devnet to run as a background process.

4. Explore the Network:

   Invoke a transaction:
   ```sh
   trix invoke
   ```

   Explore the devnet to monitor the transaction:
   ```sh
   trix explore
   ```

</Steps>
