Trix is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help developers manage projects written in the Tx3 language. It provides commands for initializing new projects, checking code for errors, generating code bindings, and interacting with development networks.

This documentation will guide you through installing Trix, setting up your first project, and using the available commands to build and manage your Tx3 projects.

## Installation Requirements and Initial Setup

<Steps>

1. Using `tx3up` (Recommended):

    `tx3up` is a tool installer that installs every tool for the Tx3 language, including Trix. It is the recommended way to install Trix as it ensures you have compatible versions of all necessary Tx3 tools. Follow the instructions on the [tx3up](./tx3up) to install `tx3up`, and then run:

    ```sh
    tx3up
    ```

</Steps>

You can verify that Trix is installed correctly by running:

```sh
trix --help
```

To start a new Tx3 project, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run the `init` command:

```sh
trix init
```

The `init` command will interactively ask you for some details about your project, such as the name, owner scope, description, and version. It will also ask which language bindings you want to generate. Based on your input, it will create a `trix.toml` configuration file and a basic `main.tx3` file in your current directory.

## Overview Commands

The sections below describe the trix commands currently exposed by the CLI. For the most up-to-date flags and advanced options run `trix <command> --help`.

Main commands:

*   `trix init`: Initialize a new Tx3 project.
*   `trix invoke`: Invoke a transaction using CShell.
*   `trix devnet`: Start a local development network.
*   `trix explore`: Explore a network using CShell.
*   `trix bindgen`: Generate code bindings for smart contracts.
*   `trix check`: Check a Tx3 package and its dependencies for errors.
*   `trix inspect`: Inspect the intermediate representation of a transaction
*   `trix test`: Run automated tests using test configuration files.
*   `trix build`: Build a Tx3 file.
*   `trix wallet`: Manage wallets.
*   `trix telemetry`: Manage telemetry settings.

## Command Details

### `trix init`

Initialize a new Tx3 project in the current directory. Scaffolds `trix.toml`, `main.tx3`, and a sample test file.

Use this to quickly create a correctly structured project so other trix commands (build, bindgen, test) work without manual configuration.

Usage:

```sh
trix init [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

- `-y`, `--yes` - Use default configuration and skip interactive prompts.

### `trix invoke`

Interactively invoke a transaction from your main Tx3 file against a running devnet. It uses CShell to assemble, sign and optionally submit the transaction.

Use this to execute single transactions during development or to script manual test steps.

Usage:

```sh
trix invoke [OPTIONS]
```

**Options**:

- `--args-json <JSON_STRING>`: Args for the TX3 transaction as a raw JSON string.
- `--args-json-path <PATH>`: Path to a JSON file with arguments for the TX3 transaction.
- `--skip-submit`: Skip submitting the transaction (useful for inspection).

If no args are provided, `trix invoke` opens an interactive prompt for selecting a transaction and filling arguments.

### `trix devnet`

Start a local development network (Dolos) prepared with wallets and initial funds according to `devnet.toml` or the project profile.

Note that running `tx3up` is required to prepare the environment before starting the devnet. For more detailed information on using the development network, please refer to the [Devnet Guide](./devnet).

Usage:

```sh
trix devnet [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `-b`, `--background`: Run the devnet as a background process (daemonize). When not backgrounded the command waits and prints the devnet process status.


### `trix explore`

Launch the CShell interactive explorer connected to devnet. It opens an interactive process for inspecting addresses, transactions and chain state.

Use this to debug transactions and examine on-chain state while developing.

Usage:

```sh
trix explore
```

### `trix bindgen`

Generate language bindings (client libraries) for the protocols and transactions defined in your Tx3 project. Bindings are templated using handlebars and can target multiple languages.

Use `bindgen` to generate typed client code that can be used from NodeJS, Rust, Go, Python, etc., making it easier to integrate Tx3 protocols into applications and tests.

Usage:

```sh
trix bindgen
```

### `trix check`

Performs static analysis and validation of the current Tx3 package and its dependencies. Runs the Tx3 parser and analyzer and returns errors if any are found.

Usage:

```sh
trix check
```

### `trix inspect`:

Inspect the intermediate representation (TIR) of a transaction defined in your Tx3 project. This command outputs the TIR JSON for a specified transaction, allowing you to examine how Tx3 compiles your code.

Usage:

```sh
trix inspect <COMMAND>
```

**Commands:**

- `tir --tx <TX>`: Inspect the intermediate representation of a transaction `<TX>`.

### `trix test`

Run automated tests using test configuration files. This command executes predefined test scenarios that include wallet creation, transaction execution, and balance verification.


Usage:

```sh
trix test <PATH>
```

**Arguments:**

*   `<PATH>`: Path to the test TOML configuration file.

The test configuration file provides a structured way to define test cases and verify the expected outcomes of executing tx3 code.

For detailed information about test configuration format and examples, see the [Testing Guide](./testing).

### `trix build`

Build a Tx3 file from the root folder, generating the TIR (Transaction Intermediate Representation) and arguments for each transaction defined in the file.

Usage:

```sh
trix build [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

*   `-o`, `--output <OUTPUT>`: Path to save the build output to a JSON file. If omitted the JSON is printed to stdout.
*   `-p`, `--profile <PROFILE>`: Select a profile (for example `devnet`, `preview`, `preprod`, `mainnet`) to resolve env files and argument values.


### `trix wallet`

Inspect or query wallets created for the devnet environment. When called with only a wallet name it prints full JSON info (addresses, public key, etc.). Subcommands return specific fields.

Usage:

```sh
trix wallet <NAME> [COMMAND]
```

**Arguments:**

*   `<NAME>`: Wallet name.

**Available Commands:**

*   `address-testnet`: Get the testnet address for the wallet
*   `address-mainnet`: Get the mainnet address for the wallet
*   `public-key`: Get the public key for the wallet
*   `public-key-hash`: Get the public key hash for the wallet

**Examples:**

Get complete wallet information (returns JSON with addresses and public key):

```sh
trix wallet bob
```

Get only the testnet address:

```sh
trix wallet bob address-testnet
```

Get only the public key:

```sh
trix wallet bob public-key
```

### `trix telemetry`

Manage telemetry settings for Trix. You can enable or disable telemetry data collection. Trix uses telemetry to help improve the tool by collecting anonymous usage data.|

Usage:

```sh
trix telemetry <COMMAND>
```
**Commands:**

*   `on` - Enable telemetry (anonymous usage data collection)
*   `off` - Disable telemetry
*   `status` - Show the current telemetry status


## Common Workflows

Here are some common workflows you might follow when developing with trix:

<Steps>

1. Starting a New Project:

    ```sh
    mkdir my_tx3_project
    cd my_tx3_project
    trix init
    ```

    Follow the prompts to set up your project.

2. Writing and Checking Code:

    Edit the `main.tx3` file and any other `.tx3` files in your project. Regularly check for errors:

    ```sh
    trix check
    ```

3. Generating Bindings:

    After writing your Tx3 code, generate language bindings to use your protocols in other applications:

    ```sh
    trix bindgen
    ```

4. Developing and Testing on a Devnet:

    Start a local development network:

    ```sh
    trix devnet
    ```

    In a separate terminal, invoke a transaction:

    ```sh
    trix invoke
    ```

    Then, in another terminal, explore the devnet to monitor the transaction:

    ```sh
    trix explore
    ```

5. Running Automated Tests:

    Create a test configuration file (e.g., `test.toml`) and run your tests:

    ```sh
    trix test test.toml
    ```

    This will automatically set up a test environment, execute the defined transactions, and verify the expected outcomes.
