`tx3up` is a command-line tool designed to simplify the installation and management of the `tx3` toolchain. Its main purpose is to provide a convenient way for users to get started with `tx3` and keep their toolchain updated.

It solves the problem of manually downloading and configuring `tx3` components by automating the process.

The tool is primarily created for developers and users who want to use the `tx3` programming language and its associated tools.

## Installation

You can download the appropriate binary for your operating system directly from the [latest releases page on the tx3up](https://github.com/tx3-lang/up/releases).

To verify that `tx3up` is installed correctly, open your terminal and run:

```sh
tx3up --version
```

This command should display the version of the `tx3up` installer.

### Initial Setup

Once `tx3up` is installed, you can use it to install the `tx3` toolchain. Running `tx3up` without any subcommands will perform a default installation of the `stable` channel and set it as the default.

```sh
tx3up
```

This will download and install the latest stable versions of the `tx3` toolchain components into a `.tx3` directory in your user's home or local data directory and configure your system's PATH to include the installed binaries.

## Commands Overview

*   `tx3up install`: Installs the tx3 toolchain or specific tools.
*   `tx3up default`: Sets the default channel for the tx3 toolchain.
*   `tx3up show`: Shows information about the installed tx3 tools.

## Command Details

### `tx3up install`

Installs the `tx3` toolchain or specific tools. If no tool is specified, it installs all available tools for the current channel. You can optionally specify a version for a specific tool.

```bash
tx3up install [tool] [version]
```

**Available Options:**

*   `tool`: (Optional) The name of the specific tool to install (e.g., `trix`, `tx3-lsp`, `dolos`, `cshell`). If omitted, all tools for the channel are installed.
*   `version`: (Optional) The specific version of the tool to install. If omitted, the latest version is installed.

**Examples:**

Install the entire `stable` toolchain:

```bash
tx3up install
```

Install only the `trix` tool:

```bash
tx3up install trix
```

Install a specific version of the `dolos` tool:

```bash
tx3up install dolos 0.21.1
```

### `tx3up default`

Sets the default channel for the `tx3` toolchain. This command creates a symlink from the `.tx3/default` directory to the specified channel's directory, effectively making the binaries in that channel the default ones accessible in your PATH.

```bash
tx3up default [channel]
```

**Available Options:**

*   `channel`: (Optional) The name of the channel to set as default. Defaults to `stable`.

**Examples:**

Set the `stable` channel as default:

```bash
tx3up default stable
```

### `tx3up show`

Displays information about the installed `tx3` tools, including their binary path, GitHub repository, and installed version.

```bash
tx3up show [tool]
```

**Available Options:**

*   `tool`: (Optional) The name of a specific tool to show information for. If omitted, information for all installed tools is displayed.

**Examples:**

Show information for all installed tools:

```bash
tx3up show
```

Show information specifically for the `trix` tool:

```bash
tx3up show trix
```

## Common Workflows

<Steps>

1. Initial Toolchain Setup:

    Install the default `stable` toolchain and set it as default.

    ```bash
    tx3up
    ```

    This is the simplest way to get started and installs all necessary components.

2. Installing a Specific Tool:

    If you only need a particular tool from the toolchain, you can install it individually.

    ```bash
    tx3up install [tool_name]
    ```

    Replace `[tool_name]` with the name of the tool you want to install (e.g., `trix`).

3. Switching Default Channels:

    If you have multiple channels installed (e.g., `stable` and `beta`), you can easily switch between them.

    ```bash
    tx3up default [channel_name]
    ```

    Replace `[channel_name]` with the name of the channel you want to use as default (e.g., `beta`). This updates the symlink to point to the desired channel's binaries.

4. Checking Installed Tool Versions:

    To see which versions of the tools are currently installed and their details.

    ```bash
    tx3up show
    ```

    Or for a specific tool:

    ```bash
    tx3up show [tool_name]
    ```
