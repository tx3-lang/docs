The testing tool is designed to assist developers in writing tests and validating their tx3 files.
It provides a structured way to define test cases and verify the expected outcomes of executing tx3 code. 

## Writing

Tests for tx3 files are written using the `TOML` format. A TOML test file typically includes the following sections:

### Wallets

Define the initial state of wallets involved in the test. You can use descriptive names like `bob` and `alice` for clarity. Each wallet should specify its initial balance or assets.

```toml
[[wallets.bob]]
lovelace = 10000000

[[wallets.alice]]
lovelace = 5000000
assets = { "Token" = 100 }
```

### Function

Specify the name of the tx3 function that will be executed for this test case.

```toml
function = "transferTx"
```

### Inputs

Specify the inputs that the tx3 function under test expects. These inputs should match the parameters defined in your tx3 code.

```toml
[inputs]
amount = 1000000
sender = "bob"
receiver = "alice"
```

### Expect

Define the expect state after the tx3 function has been executed. This section should specify the expected final values for wallets, outputs, or any other relevant state.

```toml
[[expect.bob]]
lovelace = 9000000

[[expect.alice]]
lovelace = 6000000
assets = { "Token" = 100 }
```

## Example

Here is a complete example of a TOML test file:

```toml
[[wallets.bob]]
lovelace = 10000000

[[wallets.alice]]
lovelace = 5000000
assets = { "Token" = 100 }

function = "transferTx"

[inputs]
amount = 1000000
sender = "bob"
receiver = "alice"

[[expect.bob]]
lovelace = 9000000

[[expect.alice]]
lovelace = 6000000
assets = { "Token" = 100 }
```

This test file defines two wallets, `bob` and `alice`, with initial lovelace amounts. It specifies inputs for a `transferTx` function and defines the expected lovelace amounts for 
both wallets after the transfer.
