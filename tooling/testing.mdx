The testing tool is designed to assist developers in writing tests and validating their tx3 files.
It provides a structured way to define test cases and verify the expected outcomes of executing tx3 code. 

## Writing

Tests for tx3 files are written using the `TOML` format. A TOML test file typically includes the following sections:

### Wallets

Define the initial state of wallets involved in the test. You can use descriptive names like `bob` and `alice` for clarity. Each wallet should specify its initial balance or assets.

```toml
[[wallets]]
name = "bob"
balance = 10000000

[[wallets]]
name = "alice"
balance = 5000000

# Not implemented yet
[[wallets.assets]]
name = "Token"
policy = "0x"
amount = 1
```

* **`name`**  
  A human-readable wallet name.  
  **example**: `"bob"`

* **`balance`**  
  The initial balance that the wallet will contain before the test starts.  
  **type**: `number`  
  **example**: `10000000`

### Transactions

Specify the test cases of the tx3 template.

```toml
[[transactions]]
description = "bob sends 2 ada to alice"
template = "transfer"
signer = "bob"
wait_block = true
args = { quantity = 2000000, sender = "@bob", receiver = "@alice" }

[[transactions]]
description = "alice sends back 1 ada to bob"
template = "transfer"
signer = "bob"
args = { quantity = 10000000, sender = "@alice", receiver = "@bob" }
```

* **`description`**  
  A human-readable explanation of the transaction.  
  **example**: `"bob sends 2 coins to alice"`

* **`template`**  
  The name of the predefined transaction template to use from tx3 file.  
  **example**: `"transfer"`

* **`signer`**  
  The wallet that will sign the transaction. This should match one of the defined wallets.  
  **example**: `"bob"`

* **`wait_block`**  
  Indicates whether to wait for a block confirmation before proceeding.  
  **type**: `boolean`  
  **example**: `true`

* **`args`**  
  Arguments required by the `template`. These are passed as key-value pairs. Arguments that start with `@` are mapped to wallet address, so `@bob` will be mapped to `addr_...`.  
  **type**: `object`  
  **example**: `{ quantity = 2000000, sender = "@alice", receiver = "@bob" }`

### Expect

Define the expect state after the tx3 function has been executed. This section should specify the expected final values for wallets, outputs, or any other relevant state.

```toml
[[expect]]
type = "Balance"
wallet = "bob"
amount = 9638899

[[expect]]
type = "Balance"
wallet = "alice"
amount = { target = 4638899, threshold = 300000 } 
```

* **`type`**  
  The type of expect, each type will validate the output different. As far, only `Balance` is implemented.  
  **type**: `string`  
  **example**: `Balance`

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Balance">

* **`wallet`**  
  The name of the wallet that must be validated.  
  **type**: `string`  
  **example**: `bob`

* **`amount`**  
  The amount validation, it can be absolute or aproximated. Furthermore, `target` and `threshold` are a way to validate aproximated the final balance.  
  **type**: `number | object`  
  **example**: `9638899 | { target = 4638899, threshold = 300000 }`  

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Example

Here is a complete [example](https://github.com/tx3-lang/trix/tree/main/examples/test) of a TOML test file:

```toml
file="./main.tx3"

[[wallets]]
name = "bob"
balance = 10000000

[[wallets]]
name = "alice"
balance = 5000000

[[transactions]]
description = "bob sends 2 ada to alice"
template = "transfer"
signer = "bob"
wait_block = true
args = { quantity = 2000000, sender = "@bob", receiver = "@alice" }

[[transactions]]
description = "alice sends 2 ada to bob"
template = "transfer"
signer = "alice"
args = { quantity = 2000000, sender = "@alice", receiver = "@bob" }

[[expect]]
type = "Balance"
wallet = "bob"
amount = 9638899

[[expect]]
type = "Balance"
wallet = "alice"
amount = { target = 4638899, threshold = 300000 } 
```

This test file defines two wallets, `bob` and `alice`, with initial balance amounts. It specifies the test cases for a `transfer` template and defines the expected balance amounts for 
both wallets after the test cases executed.
