Tx3 VSCode Extension is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to improve your development experience with `tx3`. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, LSP diagnostics, and interactive panels for transaction resolution and visualization.

## Installation Requirements

To use the Tx3 extension, you must first ensure that the **tx3 toolchain** is installed on your system. You can find detailed installation instructions and a quick start guide in the [official Tx3 documentation](https://docs.txpipe.io/tx3/quick-start).

Once the Tx3 toolchain is installed, you can install the VS Code extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace:

1.  Open Visual Studio Code.
2.  Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3.  Search for "Tx3 Language Support".
4.  Click the "Install" button for the extension published by TxPipe.

To verify that the installation was successful, open a file with the `.tx3` extension. You should see syntax highlighting applied to the code.

The extension requires the path to the Tx3 language server executable. By default, it looks for the executable at `~/.tx3/default/bin/tx3-lsp`. If your installation places the executable elsewhere, you can configure the path in the extension settings:

1.  Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`).
2.  Search for "Tx3".
3.  Update the "Tx3: Lsp Path" setting with the correct path to your `tx3-lsp` executable.

## Features Overview

The Tx3 Language Support extension provides the following key features:

*   **Syntax Highlighting**: Provides clear and intuitive syntax highlighting for `.tx3` files, making your code easier to read and understand.
*   **LSP Diagnostics**: Utilizes the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to deliver real-time diagnostics, including errors and warnings, helping you identify and resolve issues as you code.
*   **Tx3 Resolve Panel**: An interactive webview panel for generating the transaction CBOR from your Tx3 code using a configured TRP server.
*   **Tx3 Diagram Visualization Panel**: A graphical webview panel for visualizing transaction diagrams based on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of your Tx3 code.

## Commands Overview

The extension registers several commands within VS Code, accessible primarily through the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS):

*   `Tx3: Start Tx3 Language Server`: Starts the Tx3 language server. This is typically handled automatically when you open a `.tx3` file.
*   `Tx3: Open Tx3 Resolve Panel`: Opens the interactive panel for generating transaction CBOR.
*   `Tx3: Open Tx3 Diagram Panel`: Opens the graphical panel for visualizing transaction diagrams.

## Command Details

### `Tx3: Start Tx3 Language Server`

This command is responsible for starting the background process of the Tx3 Language Server. The language server provides features like diagnostics and data for the webview panels.

**Syntax:**

This command is not typically run manually by the user. The extension automatically attempts to start the language server when a `.tx3` file is opened, using the executable path specified in the extension settings (`tx3.lspPath`).

**Usage:**

You generally do not need to execute this command directly. If the language server fails to start automatically, ensure the `tx3.lspPath` setting is correct and that the Tx3 toolchain is properly installed.

### `Tx3: Open Tx3 Resolve Panel`

This command opens the Tx3 Resolve Panel, an interactive interface within VS Code that allows you to generate the transaction CBOR for the active `.tx3` file by interacting with a TRP server.

**Syntax:**

```
Tx3: Open Tx3 Resolve Panel
```

**Usage:**

1.  Open a `.tx3` file in the VS Code editor.
2.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3.  Type "Open Tx3 Resolve Panel" and select the command.
4.  Alternatively, click the `play` icon button that appears in the editor's title bar when a `.tx3` file is open.

The panel will open, typically in a split view. It will load the transaction data from your active `.tx3` file and allow you to interact with configured TRP servers to resolve the transaction.

### `Tx3: Open Tx3 Diagram Panel`

This command opens the Tx3 Diagram Panel, a graphical interface within VS Code that visualizes the structure of transactions defined in your active `.tx3` file.

**Syntax:**

```
Tx3: Open Tx3 Diagram Panel
```

**Usage:**

1.  Open a `.tx3` file in the VS Code editor.
2.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3.  Type "Open Tx3 Diagram Panel" and select the command.
4.  Alternatively, click the `diagram` icon button that appears in the editor's title bar when a `.tx3` file is open.

The panel will open, typically in a split view, displaying a diagram representing the structure of the transactions in your active file.

## Configuration

The Tx3 Language Support extension provides the following configuration options in VS Code Settings:

*   `tx3.lspPath`: Specifies the path to the Tx3 language server executable.
    *   Type: `string`
    *   Default: `~/.tx3/default/bin/tx3-lsp`
    *   Description: The absolute path to the `tx3-lsp` executable on your system.
*   `tx3.trpServers`: A list of TRP servers that the Tx3 Resolve Panel can use to resolve transactions.
    *   Type: `array` of objects
    *   Description: Configure the name, URL, and optional headers for each TRP server.

**Example `tx3.trpServers` configuration (in `settings.json`):**

```json
"tx3.trpServers": [
    {
        "name": "Demeter Cardano Preview",
        "url": "https://cardano-preview.trp-m1.demeter.run",
        "headers": {
            "dmtr-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "Custom Local Server",
        "url": "http://localhost:8080"
    }
]
```
