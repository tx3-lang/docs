To start working with Tx3 you'll need to install the toolchain. The fastest way to setup your environment is to run `tx3up`, which bundles everything you need in a single install experience:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="linux">
    You can install Tx3up on linux system using the following command:

    ```
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/tx3-lang/up/releases/latest/download/tx3up-installer.sh | sh
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="mac">
    You can use Homebrew to install the latest version of Tx3up in Mac (both x86 / ARM64)

    ```
    brew install txpipe/tap/tx3up
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

Once you've installed `tx3up`, run the following command to execute the install of toolchain:

```
tx3up
```

You'll see how the process downloads and install many components. By the end, you should have everything you need.

Run the following command to check the installed versions of each component:

```
tx3up show
```

The installer has a lot of advanced features, check our [tx3up guide](/tools/tx3up) if you want to learn more.

## Channels

`tx3up` has support for multiple _channels_. A channel is a way of grouping tools at different levels of maturity. The available channels are:

| Channel | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `stable`| versions that are considered stable for general use |
| `beta` | versions that have experimental features |

The default channel is `stable`. If you want to switch to a different channel, use the `tx3up use` command as in the example below:

```
tx3up use beta
```

If you're in doubt of which channel you're currently using, run the `tx3up show` command and the info will appear in the top banner.

You can switch back and forth as much as you like. Under the hood, the only change is how we symlink binaries in your file system.
